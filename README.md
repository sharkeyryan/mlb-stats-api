# mlb-stats-api

This project uses MLB stats for teams and their current season schedule to see w/L ratio and how many games they have lost by 2 or less runs. Generates a CSV output for analysis.

Working to add a Django Project to host an API to deliver these findings upon request from a front-end dashboard.

This project uses a Python wrapper for the official MLB Stats API found here: https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI
